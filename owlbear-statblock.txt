Traits

Deadly Leap. The owlbear's long jump is up to 30 feet and their high jump is 15 feet, with or without a running start. If the owlbear leaps at least 20 feet toward a target and then hits them with a Bite or Claw attack, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Keen Sight and Smell. The owlbear has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight or smell.

Actions

Multiattack. The owlbear makes one Bite and one Claw attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage, and the owlbear can move the target 5 feet in any direction.

Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

Bear Hug (Recharge 4-6). The owlbear attempts to grab and crush a creature they can see within 5 feet of them. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and is grappled (escape DC 15). On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and is not grappled. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of their turns. The grapple ends when the owlbear uses Bear Hug on another target or makes a Claw attack against another target.

Reactions

Hulking Rush. When the owlbear takes damage, they can move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
